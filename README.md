## FAQ

#### Why?
I wanted to try something with the React Framework. This game was my learning project.

#### And why Gulp?
Because I've used Gulp with many project before, so setup was quite easy. But you're right, Webpack is probably a better choice. Feel free to switch to Webpack and use proper component import / export functionality.
